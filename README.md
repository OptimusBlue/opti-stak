# Compile
If you would like to compile your own build for Windows you can use these build instruction originally from xmr-stak.
https://github.com/fireice-uk/xmr-stak/blob/master/doc/compile/compile_Windows.md

Once you have it compiled your build you will need to rename "xmr-stak.exe" to "opti-stak.exe" and copy the build file into the same directory and the CN GUI Miner for it to work.
